# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

## Initial Settup

We are going to use `NextAuth.js` for aunthetication.
Used `@/*` for the question from `What import alias would you like to use?`
`npm run dev`
Use `vercel` to depoly the app

- Will fail the deployment : getting an error for `ENV` setting
  Use `PlanetScale` (production ready db)
- QuickStart PlanetScale with prisma : update `schema.prisma` and `ENV` for dbURL
- Push the change : `npx prisma db push`
- Can check on prisma studio and add data to the database directly : `npx prisma studio
